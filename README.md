Discord bot to notify of UCSC dining hall menu items as well as when the dining hall is less busy. Rewriting my old bot in discord.js cause discord.py is way outdated

# Todo
Add commands
* busyness [Dining Hall] 
* default set <dining_hall> [] // Set user-specific default dining hall, other commands will use your set default dining hall (if not set will error), will need database to store everything
* notify 
  * busy [Dining Hall]
  * food_item <food> [Dining Hall]
